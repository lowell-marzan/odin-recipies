        <b>Directions:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak bamboo skewers in water for about 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to 400ÂºF. Line a large baking tray with foil & lay 2 wire cooling racks across the top. Place the bacon strips (cut in half) on top of the wire racks on the tray & bake for about 6-8 minutes on the middle oven rack (you only want to cook the bacon about halfway). Remove from the oven (leaving the oven on) & let cool enough to handle. Pat the strips with paper towels to remove most of the grease.</li>
            <li>Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels & sprinkle them with lemon juice & salt. Wrap each shrimp with a half strip of bacon & skewer, putting 7 shrimps on one skewer (the skewer will keep . Lay the loaded skewers on the tray with the wire racks & brush the tops of each wrapped shrimp with BBQ sauce (optional). Bake on the middle rack for 5 minutes. Pull the tray out of the oven, turn the skewers over, & brush each shrimp with the rest of the sauce (if you're using sauce). Bake for another 5 minutes & then turn on the broiler & bake for a couple of minutes, until the bacon is crispy. Turn the skewers again & broil for a couple of minutes more to crisp the other side. Remove from the oven & let cool enough to handle the skewers before serving.</li>
