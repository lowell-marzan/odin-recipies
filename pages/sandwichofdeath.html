        <b>Directions:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350ÂºF. Spray a large baking dish with non-stick spray. In a large bowl, use your hands to squish together all of the meatball ingredients until well combined. Roll into balls (about ping pong size) & place them in the baking dish in a single layer. Cover with foil & bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked through. Remove the meatballs to a container & discard the juices from the baking tray.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the spaghetti or pizza sauce with the BBQ sauce, & then spread the mixture on the cut open sub roll. Fold several slices of sandwich pepperoni & Canadian bacon in half & lay them alternately across the bottom half of the sub roll. Top with a row of meatballs & optional extra shredded parmesan &/or chopped fresh parsley, & then close with the top half of the sub roll. Eat wearing cut-off jeans & a mullet and DO NOT LEAVE SANDWICH UNACCOMPANIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.</li>
