        <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Powder Pancake Mix</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>1-2 Packages of Pre-cooked Bacon</li>

    <p>
        <b>Directions:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a frying pan or electric skillet. Mix the pancake powder with the appropriate amount of water as per the directions on the box.</li>
            <li>Pour a circle of your preferred size into the pan (or onto the skillet) & while the bottom side is cooking place several pieces of bacon onto the uncooked top side of the pancake, tearing the bacon strips as needed to fit onto the pancake. Once the top of the pancake is bubbly, carefully & quickly flip it over so that the bacon side can cook.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat once the pancake is the desired golden-ness & repeat until all of your batter & bacon are used up.</li>
        </ol>
